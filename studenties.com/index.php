		IT is no exaggeration to say that the Asia-Pacific has an unrivalled pedigree in cashless payments. The rate of adoption is faster than anywhere else in the world, and this is especially true in emerging Asia where non-cash payments are growing at 22 per cent. But the region's more developed economies have also been quick to embrace new ways of paying. For example, in Australia, contactless now accounts for two-thirds of credit and debit card point-of-sales payments.

</p>
																							<div class="ZvlszcpIGp">I’m a proponent of napping—but it needs to be done right. When not managed correctly, naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. Scientific evidence indicates that long and frequent naps elevate risk of poor nighttime sleep and create more, not less, sleep deprivation. Excessive and poorly timed sleep during the day may undermine also undermine cognitive function, and mood. (I’ll talk more about napping in an upcoming article.)

Biphasic and polyphasic sleep: what you need to know
I can’t go so far as to recommend a biphasic or polyphasic sleep routine, generally or for any particular group of people. I’m just not convinced, at this point, that these alternate sleep routines can deliver the quantity and quality of sleep people need on a regular basis.</div>
																							<div class="GMAHfMzGzhNc">Everybody is busy these days, looking to squeeze as much as they can out of every moment of the day, and night. Sure, you know you need roughly eight hours of sleep—but wouldn’t it be great if you could somehow get that ‘ideal eight’ in five hours? (Hint: it’s possible, but not too healthy.)

I have patients who are interested in bio-hacking their sleep, whether to maximize their time efficiency, or to boost performance, or both. This often leads to a discussion of biphasic and polyphasic sleep, and whether it’s a good idea to try. 

Not familiar with polyphasic sleep? You’re in good company. As you’re about to learn, although these sleep patterns may have an ancient history, they’re kind of new all over again, as people look for ways to maximize the efficiency of their rest. It’s a good time to take closer look at these sleep patterns—what science tells us about their history, how people are using them today, and what risks are associated with them. 

What are biphasic and polyphasic sleep? 
These are patterns of sleep that involve sleep in segments, rather than in a single, uninterrupted block of time. Think about the sleep pattern most of us keep: a stretch of 7-8 hours a night asleep, followed by a long, usually unbroken stretch of wakefulness of about 16 hours, before dropping back into sleep. That sleep pattern, so common in the United States and much of the industrialized world, is known as “monophasic sleep.” 

Biphasic and polyphasic sleep break up that single period of sleep into segments of rest that occur at different times throughout the day and night. 

Biphasic sleep divides sleep into two parts. It may involve a long stretch of sleep overnight, with a much shorter block of sleep during the day. A 6-hour nightly sleep period might be paired with a 30-90 minute nap during the day. 

Biphasic sleep is sometimes known as “siesta sleep,” a nod to some Western cultures, including Spain and Greece, that continue to incorporate the afternoon rest as part of their cultures and commonly-held sleep patterns. 

Polyphasic sleep breaks up sleep into more than two episodes throughout the day and night. Polyphasic sleepers might sleep as many as six times a day, in some combination of 2-3 hour blocks of sleep and 30-90 minute naps, which over 24 hours are meant to add up to the equivalent of a full night of rest. </div>
																							<p>
	Digital wallets that allow users to pay for goods and services within a smartphone app have tended to dominate the discussion of cashless payments in Asia, and particularly China. But the types and methods of cashless payments vary widely market by market and there's no single leader, with QR codes, near-field technology for bank transfers, and pre-paid cards all gaining traction.

</p>
																							<span class="eymLUBGoDs">What is clear are some of the challenges associated with maintaining a segmented sleep schedule. In addition, there are people who definitely shouldn’t attempt to use these sleep routines. 

Managing a biphasic or polyphasic sleep routine is NOT about napping here and there, when the mood strikes. These sleep patterns require a strict schedule, to ensure you’re getting sufficient sleep. No matter how much you’d like to, you can’t get eight hours of sleep in five hours. Consistency is crucial to healthy sleep, no matter what sleep schedule you follow. </span>
																							<span class="vYcsKBuYrUJu">These may sound like new approaches to sleep—but there are scientists and historians who think that forms of polyphasic and biphasic sleep patterns have an ancient history, and were once the norm for human sleep. Research over the past couple of decades suggests that our ancestors, for most of human history, may have relied on biphasic sleep patterns. The shift to the 8-hour night of sleep may have been a relatively recent development, one that was spurred on by industrialization and widespread access to electricity and artificial light. Some scientific findings suggest that our ancestors sleep patterns may have included a stint of sleep lasting 3-5 hours, followed by a period of time awake, engaging in some light activity, followed by another stretch of 3-5 hours of sleep. 

If you imagine the daily patterns of life in a pre-industrial, pre-electric age, this pattern makes some sense. Living closely in sync with natural daylight, the first phase of sleep would have likely come with the onset of darkness. That stretch of darkness, lasting 12 hours or more, would have been a long time to sleep without interruption. Waking partway through, to have something to eat, have sex, or engage is some other light activity, could likely have been common practice, before falling back to sleep before waking at dawn. 

These segmented sleep patterns may indeed have a long history among humans—but does that mean they make sense for us today? Sleep is influenced by many factors, some biological, and others social. Switching to a segmented sleep routine is no simple matter—and for most people, it’s not practical or advisable. </span>

	The region's governments have been quick to recognise the need to support and advance these new ways of paying, and in response are creating cutting-edge solutions to meet growing demand. Perhaps one of the most striking examples of government-driven innovation comes from India where the government has set-up the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The platform allows consumers to use a single smartphone application to make payments through any bank that joins, including non-traditional financial institutions such as Indian digital wallet provider Paytm. Since launching in April 2016, UPI has signed up 97 banks and has processed INR270 billion (S$5.4 billion) worth of transactions.

</p>
																							<p>
	In Singapore, cashless payments took a major step forward in 2017 with the introduction of PayNow - a national real-time payment platform. PayNow allows individuals to send payments to each other, across participating banks in Singapore, with just a mobile phone or identity card number. Since its launch, more than 1 million Singapore residents have used PayNow, and over S$900 million has been transferred via the platform.

</p>
																							<p>
	Singapore will be implementing a standardised QR code, SG QR, later this year. The government-led initiative requires all service providers, including e-wallet providers, to adopt SG QR for scan-and-pay services. This brings significant convenience to merchants, who would now only need to have one QR code to accept payments across all platforms.

</p>
																							<p>
	Coupled with the launch of PayNow Corporate in August 2018, which enables businesses to send and receive payments, soon every department store, neighbourhood shop, or charity soliciting for donations, can accept scan-and-pay e-payment.

</p>
																							<p>
	But for all the advances, the region has a long way to go before it can truly be called cashless. Though it can be hard to tell from some of the fevered commentary around digital, cash is still the predominant method of paying for goods in most Asia-Pacific countries, with 55 per cent of personal spending processed by cash and cheque. Even in China, this figure is 47 per cent.

</p>
																							<p>
	Moreover the lack of uniformity in the types of cashless payments across Asia - it may be easy to pay by QR code in China but you would be hard put to find the same option in Australia - underscores how much of the growth until now has been limited to domestic customer bases.

</p>
																							<span class="uMZCuOaaxIxu">Keep in mind here that I’m describing the theory and thinking behind why people would try this—not what I currently believe or what is necessarily true.

The idea behind adopting the Uberman sleep schedule is that REM sleep is the only stage of sleep that actually matters (that’s when your body is recovering and healing itself). Since we typically only spend about 20% of our time asleep in REM, the goal is to cut out the remaining 80% and “hack” your body to gain the full benefit of several hours of sleep in only a fraction of the time. In a normal adult, it takes somewhere around ninety minutes after you fall asleep to enter your first REM cycle; this means that once you start only taking twenty to forty minute naps every few hours, you will be getting no REM sleep at all, and you will become sleep deprived. Eventually your body will be desperate enough that it will start entering REM sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow for your naps. The theory is that after a few weeks or months of acclimation, your body should completely adapt to these new instant-REM naps. If you’re doing twenty minutes every three hours, that adds up to a total of over two and a half hours of REM sleep per day—a typical seven-hour-a-night sleeper spending 20% of their time in REM is getting less than an hour and a half. You’d actually be getting more REM during your 160 minutes per day of sleep than someone sleeping seven hours.

This surplus of REM sleep is attributed by people who claim to be living on this schedule to feeling more awake and alive than ever—sharper wits, clearer minds, and significantly increased productivity beyond what would be expected by just having a few extra hours awake each day. Other purported benefits are that your dreams are richer, more vivid, and often lucid (meaning you can consciously control them while they are occurring). Basically everything is awesome. Why would anyone not want to do this?

Well, if you saw the Seinfeld episode, you might have a few ideas why.</span>

	The deployment of cashless technology in Asia still faces the challenge of working across multiple countries and adhering to local regulations, and while the growth in digital wallets in Asia has been phenomenal, only a handful are able to provide users with services in more than one Asian country, let alone on an international basis.

</p>
																							<p>
	But far from being a reason for pessimism, the region's high cash use shows that the most exciting developments in digital payments are still ahead of us.

</p>
																							<p>
	New solutions are coming online all the time. Recently, HSBC became the first foreign bank in China to offer customers the ability to pay overseas tuition fees via smartphone. Upcoming innovations include financial institutions delivering credit cards directly to a customer's digital wallet once approval has been given, with no need to wait for a card to arrive in the post.

																							<p>Being in the most dynamic region in the world for digital payments can also be a source of opportunity. Companies and service providers with a strong foothold in the Asia-Pacific are perfectly positioned to export their technology and capture a global lead, as the challenges of developing systems that can work across borders and currencies are solved.</p>
																							<div class="vZhpdFBPAd" style="background: red;">I understand the interest in these sleep routines, and in trying to make the most of every hour in the day. I’ll continue to watch with interest as these sleep patterns are subjected to more scientific study. Ultimately, there are no real short-cuts to healthy sleep. The smartest time management strategy is to focus on getting the high-quality sleep you need at night, and taking full advantage of all the physical, emotional, and cognitive power that your night sleep gives you during your waking day.</div>
																							<div class="XiwPHQStYwhZ">At the time I’m writing this, it’s been almost eighteen years since the Seinfeld season finale, and nearly twenty years since the Friar’s Club episode where Kramer tried to emulate Leonardo da Vinci’s alleged habit of only sleeping twenty minutes at a time every three hours. I’m sure I saw it when it first aired, but I was still in high school and probably didn’t give it much thought at the time. That all changed a few years later. I occasionally see the subject of polyphasic sleep and the “Uberman” sleep schedule crop up, so I’m going to share my personal experience with it.

I met my future wife online while I was in college. This was still in the early days of the Internet, so dating sites and social networks like Facebook didn’t exist yet—if you wanted to meet people online, you either used newsgroups, web forums, or IRC. We met in an IRC channel used for out-of-character socialization between members of an email-based Star Trek role playing simulation. Yeah—it doesn’t get much geekier than that, right? She was the captain of her own ship, and I was a civilian bartender (like a male version of Whoopi Goldberg’s character on TNG), and our in-game flirting slowly migrated out into real-life flirting. I was still in Canada and she lived in Florida at the time, which made a relationship difficult, but we managed. To make a long story short, soon after I graduated from college we got engaged and I was on my way to Florida with a fiance visa.

The thing about fiance visas is that they didn’t (and maybe still don’t) come with a work permit—it could take anywhere up to a year after moving to the US to file all the necessary paperwork, wait for responses, file additional paperwork, get your fingerprints scanned, and pay various fees before you can legally get a job; and the whole time you’re waiting, you’re not allowed to leave the country or else everything is voided and you have to start over from scratch (including getting a new visa before being allowed back in—a process that could also take up to a year or longer). Suffice it to say, I had a lot of free time on my hands, and no time-sensitive commitments like a job to hold me down. I spent a lot of my time working on personal projects to sharpen my programming skills, and helping my father-in-law (off the books) with his software business. It was during this time that one of my friends (who was living with me and my wife at the time) reminded me of Kramer’s comically failed attempt at the odd sleeping schedule; he told me that it was a real thing, and pointed out that I was in a perfect situation to try it out. After a little bit of research, I completely agreed.</div>
